# RealestateManager

## Manage your Real Estate Company easily

  This app helps you in the management of the houses entrusted to you by your customers. You have two main parts, the display part and the administration part.
  
  In the display part, you will be able to see in an optimized mode the list of your customers, the houses in your charge, and even the different occupants of each house (including the payment of their rent). You have for each client the list of his houses, for each house, the list of his occupants, and for each occupant, the list of his payments. There is a tab for easy access to each list except for the occupants. A search feature is under development and will be available soon. The administration part allows you to edit all this information as you wish. There is among others, the management of users with access rights to the data, modification, permissions, and everything related to database management.
